# Program Visualisation

MNL has an interpreter called Tarsius. Tarsius was built with program visualization in mind, meaning all evaluations are done in the visual workspace. This is in contrast to a text-based programming language, where it is difficult to show the function value or the process of function application (beta reduction).

When the expression block type is a function, users can check the function value's content by right-clicking on the block and choosing `Function Value` from the block menu.

Users can show the beta reduction process by right-clicking on the application block and choosing `Beta Reduction`. In the beta reduction window, they can see `the substitution step` arranged sequentially from top to bottom and check `the value of the block`.
