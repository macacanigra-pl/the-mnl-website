# Program Visualisation

One of MNL capabilities is the program visualization (a.k.a Tarsius). In contrast with text-based programming language where is difficult to show the function value or the process of function application (beta reduction). Building the pretty print of the function value and beta reduction in text-based programming language is challanging. Start
