# Getting Started

## Just Drag, Drop, and Attach the block

<div class="annotate" markdown>

To start constructing a program in MNL, drag a block from the toolbox to the playground area and attach it to another block.
There is a main block (1) acts as the parent block. The main block will hold declaration block only.

</div>

1.  :man_raising_hand: The black block with MNL on the top.

## Declaration

A declaration means binding a name to a value. There are two declaration blocks in MNL: variable and function.
[The function block](function.md#the-function) is a simple model of binding a variable block with a lambda block.

### Variable

Creating a complete variable block requires an identity block and an expression block. The example below shows how to give a `variable_in_MNL` name to the string "MNL is easy to learn". When you need the "MNL is easy to learn" value, access the bound variable by name `variable_in_MNL`.

=== "SML"

    ``` sml linenums="1"
    val variable_in_MNL = "MNL is easy to learn"
    ```

=== "Scala"

    ``` scala linenums="1"
    val variable_in_MNL = "MNL is easy to learn"
    ```

## Expression

Expression is a value. Every expression blocks have its value including operators, constants, and constructor.

### Operator

<div class="annotate" markdown>

There are two types of primitive operators based on input: unary (1) and binary (2) operator.

</div>

1.  :man_raising_hand: Take one input.
2.  :man_raising_hand: Take two inputs.

=== "SML"

    ``` sml linenums="1"
    (* SML does not support type inference for a tuple as a parameter. 
    Other ML languages may support the syntax below. *)
    fun the_greater (pair) = if ((#1 pair) < (#2 pair))
      then
        (#2 pair)
      else
        (#1 pair)
    val two_or_three = the_greater((2, 3))
    ```

=== "Scala"

    ``` scala linenums="1"
    def the_greater (pair: (Float, Float)) : Float = if ((pair(0)) < (pair(1)))
      then
        (pair(1))
      else
        (pair(0))
    val two_or_three = the_greater((2, 3))
    ```


### Sequence

A sequence is a collection of expressions that are evaluated sequentially. The last expression is the type and value of a sequence block.
