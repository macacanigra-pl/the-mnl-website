# About

Macaca Nigra Language [MnL] is a block-based functional programming language. The goal is to help users learn to program. The user can see all processes, such as beta reduction and function value. It also uses visual capabilities such as shape and color to convey meaning to the user.

Some features still need to be improved as a lab language, such as the advanced circularity check (occurrence check) in type inference, reducing the memory used for the tail function and continuation passing style, etc.
