# About

Macaca Nigra Language (MNL) is a block-based functional programming language designed to help users learn programming. It allows users to visualize all processes, such as beta reduction and function value. The language also uses visual capabilities such as shape and color to convey meaning to the user.

However, it still needs improvement in certain areas to function effectively. These include enhancing the advanced circularity check (occurrence check) in type inference, optimizing memory usage for tail functions, and refining the continuation-passing style.
